## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Release Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extensions
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Git for version control

### Local Development (devPlugins)
For rapid development and testing:
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -DeployLocal
```
- Copies the plugin to `%APPDATA%\XIVLauncher\devPlugins\AetherFM`
- XIVLauncher automatically loads this version (overrides repository version)
- Perfect for fast iteration and debugging

### Test Repository Version
To test the plugin as end users would experience it:
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -SwitchToRepo
```
- Removes the local devPlugins version
- XIVLauncher loads the version from your repository
- Essential for user experience testing

### Create Release Package
To prepare a release for distribution:
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Zip
```
- Creates `AetherFM.zip` ready for GitHub release
- Includes all necessary files and assets
- Upload this ZIP to your GitHub release

### Complete Release Process

1. **Update Version Numbers:**
   - Update version in `AetherFM.json`
   - Update version in `pluginmaster.json`
   - Update version in `CHANGELOG.md`

2. **Build and Test:**
   ```powershell
   .\build.ps1 -DeployLocal    # Test locally
   .\build.ps1 -SwitchToRepo   # Test repository version
   .\build.ps1 -Zip            # Create release package
   ```

3. **Publish Release:**
   - Create new release on GitHub
   - Upload the `AetherFM.zip` file
   - Update `pluginmaster.json` with new version info
   - Push changes to repository

### Best Practices

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical:** Never leave both devPlugins and repository versions active simultaneously
- **devPlugins always takes priority** over repository versions
- Use `-SwitchToRepo` before testing repository functionality
- Use `-DeployLocal` for development iterations

**Development Workflow:**
- Use `-DeployLocal` for rapid development and testing
- Use `-SwitchToRepo` for user experience validation
- Use `-Zip` for release preparation
- Always update version numbers before releasing
